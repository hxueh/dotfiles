# Language & Communication

- All code, comments, documentation, and messages must be in English only
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic

# Code Quality Standards

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow language-specific best practices and conventions
- Prefer explicit over implicit when it improves clarity
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate error messages
- Validate inputs and sanitize outputs

## Git Workflow

- All commit messages must follow the **Conventional Commits** standard.
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change per commit)
- Write descriptive commit messages explaining the "why" not just the "what"

## Security & Performance

- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info)
- Optimize for readability first, performance second
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper input validation

## Documentation

- Update README.md files when adding new features
- Include usage examples for new functions/modules
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Use natural language descriptions instead of actual code implementation
- When code is necessary, provide only function signatures with comments explaining what the code should do
- Focus on explaining the purpose, behavior, and usage rather than showing implementation details

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality when applicable
- Ensure existing tests pass before committing
